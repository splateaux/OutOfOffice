This project creates a WCF server that runs as a console app.  When the client sends information to it,
the information is stored in the Items folder that is created immediately below its folder.  The
information is also echoed to the console.

The service requires administrative privilege to run.  To execute it, just right-click the EXE and
select "Run as adminstrator".  As the screen will say, press <Enter> to exit.
